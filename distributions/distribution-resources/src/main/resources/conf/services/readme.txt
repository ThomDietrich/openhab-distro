openHAB2 conf/services folder

Your service configurations will reside here.
All configuration files have to have the ".cfg" file extension.
Service configuration files will be automatically created as soon as you install a binding/ui/persistence/... that needs further configuration.

Check out the openHAB2 documentation for more details: http://docs.openhab.org
